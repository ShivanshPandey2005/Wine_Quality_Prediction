# Wine_Quality_Prediction

Ever wondered if a machine can judge the quality of wine just by looking at its chemical properties? This project uses machine learning to predict the quality of wine based on features like acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol content, and more.

Trained on a real dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository, this model can help automate wine grading and quality control.

**🎯 Objective**
Build a regression/classification model that takes various physicochemical tests of wine as input and predicts its quality on a scale (typically 0–10).

**🔍 Features Used**
Some of the key features used to predict wine quality:

Fixed Acidity

Volatile Acidity

Citric Acid

Residual Sugar

Chlorides

Free Sulfur Dioxide

Total Sulfur Dioxide

Density

pH

Sulphates

Alcohol

🧠** Techniques Used**
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with seaborn & matplotlib

🧼 **Data Preprocessing** (missing values, scaling, outlier detection)

🤖 Model Training with:

Linear Regression / Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

🧪 Evaluation Metrics:

Regression: RMSE, MAE, R² score

Classification: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, F1 Score

🧠 Optional hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
